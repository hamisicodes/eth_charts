## Eth_charts
- Making use of the ethereum client to obtain  information from the blockchain.
- Using Alchemy to run a Node
- Presenting the information in the form of charts (using chart.js)

## chart 1
The first chart is the BASEFEE of each block. So the X-axis is the block number, and the Y-axis is the BASEFEE. 

## chart 2
The second chart is the miner fee. The chart is able to toggle between the median and mean of the miner fee (as this will be the average across all the transactions in the block).
The chart should have a lookback of 100 blocks and update when new blocks come in. 

## chart 3
The third chart is to monitor the logs of an arbitrary ERC20 token address you provide.
Each block that passes, plot the total volume of the transfers (if any). Again, have a lookback of 100.
